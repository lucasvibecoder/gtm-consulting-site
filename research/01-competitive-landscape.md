# Module 1: Competitive Landscape Research

**Research Date:** February 2026  
**Research Goal:** Understand the competitive landscape, positioning, pricing, and differentiation of fractional GTM engineers and Clay agencies.

---

## Part A: Individual GTM Engineers / Fractional Consultants

### Jordan Crawford / Blueprint GTM (blueprintgtm.com)

**Headline / One-Liner Positioning:**
- "First principles GTM engineering" - teaching teams to build and launch sales campaigns in a single week using messages prospects would genuinely pay to receive
- Explicitly positions against the "Predictable Revenue model" being dead
- Provocative positioning: "mounting an AI SDR on top of an outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse"

**Services Offered:**
- **Courses (DIY):**
  - "Who to Target and What to Say" - $999 (PVP and PQS frameworks)
  - "Agent SEVEN" - $299 (3-hour course on building AI agents in Clay)
  - "AutoClaygent" - $499 (teaching Claude Code to write and improve Clay agents)
  - Total DIY: $1,797 for all three courses
- **Implementation Service:**
  - "Claude Code for Campaigns" - $20,000/month for 3-month minimum
  - Includes: 3-10 custom playbooks, full team training on Claude Code, complete context deployment, immediate playbook activation
  - Delivery model: Blueprint handles system design and team enablement; customer deploys playbooks through email, phone, marketing, LinkedIn

**Pricing:**
- Courses: $299-$999 each
- Implementation: $20,000/month (3-month minimum)
- Generated over $235,000 in social proof sales (underrepresents actual customer revenue)

**Key Differentiator:**
- **Teaching-first approach** - transfers knowledge rather than creating dependency
- **Permissionless Value Prop (PVP) framework** - messages that have inherent value regardless of sale
- **Pain Qualified Segments (PQS)** - segmentation based on specific pain points creating buying urgency
- Explicit rejection of complexity in favor of first principles
- Focus on "Claude Code era" - autonomous agents that write code and improve recursively

**Content Strategy:**
- Active YouTube channel with technical implementation details
- Recent content: "The Claude Code Era: Mastering Autonomous GTM Agents", "How To Scale LinkedIn and Email Outreach Horizontally"
- Positions at forefront of technical GTM innovation
- Multi-channel presence: YouTube, courses, social media

**Weakness / Gap:**
- Primarily educational model may not appeal to companies wanting fully done-for-you execution
- Requires client team to execute playbooks (not pure agency model)
- Lower barrier to entry (courses) may attract tire-kickers vs. serious buyers

---

### Nick Zeckets / Smoke Signals AI (smokesignals.ai)

**Headline / One-Liner Positioning:**
- "Complete GTM operating system builder" rather than point solution provider
- Contrarian insight: "most AI tools applied to GTM have made things worse, not better"
- Willing to "turn away prospects because the timing wasn't right" - positions on selectivity and integrity

**Services Offered:**
- **90-day Build engagements** for one market segment
- Four integrated components:
  1. Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) development (closed-won/lost analysis, data enrichment, psychographic profiling)
  2. Proprietary signal design and detection systems (custom vs. commoditized intent data)
  3. Content development and demand creation (voice of customer, podcast systems, high-value resources)
  4. Unified motion orchestration (playbooks, auto-drafted emails, meeting prep, LinkedIn content)
- After 90-day build: client chooses to maintain system with Smoke Signals, expand to new segments, or transition to internal ownership

**Pricing:**
- Not publicly listed - custom consultation required
- Estimated: $50,000-$150,000 for typical B2B software companies (based on market rates for this depth)
- Pricing focuses on value creation and alignment rather than hourly rates

**Key Differentiator:**
- **Refusal to treat AI as standalone solution** - rebuilds infrastructure from first principles with AI as foundation
- **Proprietary signal methodology** - translates sales intuition into custom detection systems
- **Willingness to turn away poor-fit prospects** - establishes trust through selectivity
- Custom signal examples: SEC filings for equity compensation risk, integration roadmap requirements
- Prevents "handoff decay" - maintains unified context across all touchpoints

**Content Strategy:**
- Moderate public visibility through podcast appearances
- Focus on cutting through "GTM AI noise" and "real operational rigor"
- Selective approach reinforces premium positioning
- More focused on quality over quantity of content

**Weakness / Gap:**
- Higher price point may exclude early-stage startups
- 90-day build structure may be too long for companies needing quick wins

## Key Insights: Clay Agency vs. Fractional GTM Engineer

### When Companies Choose Clay Agencies:
- **Need rapid implementation** - Claygencies deliver in weeks vs. months for fractional GTM engineers
- **Want done-for-you execution** - agencies handle entire implementation and execution
- **Standard technology stack** - Clay, HubSpot, Salesforce, basic marketing automation
- **Lack internal expertise** - want to avoid building full internal team
- **Need quick proof of concept** - testing whether automation-driven revenue approaches work
- **Prefer predictable project deliverables** - clear phases, milestones, structured approach

### When Companies Choose Fractional GTM Engineers:
- **Anticipate significant growth** - need scalable foundations vs. point solutions
- **Complex technology environment** - custom systems, proprietary data, unique integrations
- **Want to build permanent internal capability** - fractional engineers mentor development
- **Need flexibility** - adjust priorities and scope based on emerging business needs
- **Multiple functions need coordination** - sales, marketing, customer success, product
- **Complex B2B segments** - long sales cycles, multi-stakeholder buying groups, intricate ABM

### Pricing Comparison:
- **Clay Agencies:** $3,000-$15,000 monthly (many around $6K-$8K)
- **Fractional GTM Engineers:** $2,000-$9,000 monthly ($200-$400/hour, $3K-$6K for part-time, $6K-$10K for comprehensive)
- **Total Cost of Ownership:** Both significantly less than full-time CMO ($250K-$350K annually) or in-house teams ($500K+ annually)

### Knowledge Transfer:
- **Teaching-first Claygencies:** Systematic knowledge transfer, team independence, capability building
- **Traditional Claygencies:** May maintain control for client lock-in, creates dependency
- **Fractional GTM Engineers:** Natural knowledge transfer through day-to-day collaboration, but depth depends on individual commitment to mentoring

## Summary: Competitive Positioning Analysis

### Overused Angles:
- "We build your outbound engine"
- "AI-powered lead gen"
- "More pipeline, less BDRs"
- "GTM engineering for B2B"
- "Automated revenue systems"

### Underserved Gaps:
- **Teaching-first models** (most agencies create dependency)
- **Signal-based workflows** (beyond generic intent data)
- **Context management** (addressing AI output degradation)
- **System architecture thinking** (vs. platform optimization)
- **Transparent knowledge transfer** (vs. client lock-in)

### Market Trends:
1. **Shift from recommendation-based to implementation-based consulting**
2. **Pivot toward AI-native infrastructure** (AI as foundation, not enhancement)
3. **Emphasis on transparency and selectivity** (turning away poor-fit prospects)
4. **Specialization and vertical focus** (vs. generalist consulting)
5. **Teaching-first models becoming mainstream** (capability building vs. dependency)
