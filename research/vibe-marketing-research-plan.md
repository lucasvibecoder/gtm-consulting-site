## Research Goal

Understand the competitive landscape, buyer language, and positioning gaps for fractional GTM engineering / Clay automation consulting — so you can build a landing page, packaged offer, and lead magnet that doesn't sound like everyone else.

---

## Module 1: Competitive Landscape (20 min)

**What you're trying to learn:** Who else does what you do, how they position, what they charge, and where they're weak.

### Part A: Individual GTM Engineers / Fractional Consultants

These are your direct competitors — solo operators and small shops doing similar work. Research each one.

**People to research:**

| Name | LinkedIn | Website |
|------|----------|---------|
| Jordan Crawford | linkedin.com/in/jordancrawford | blueprintgtm.com |
| Garrett Wolfe | — | getaob.com |
| Nick Zeckets | linkedin.com/in/nzeckets | smokesignals.ai |
| Willy Hernandez | linkedin.com/in/willyalexishernandez | thegtmfactory.com |
| Jacob Dietle | linkedin.com/in/jacob-dietle | taste.systems |
| Mike Fishbein | linkedin.com/in/michaelbfishbein | atherial.ai |
| Eric Nowoslawski | — | growthenginex.com |
| Sagar Tiwari | — | bluemodern.com |

**Perplexity Queries:**

```
1. "Research these GTM consultants and their businesses. For each, tell me: how they position themselves, what services they offer, pricing if available, what makes them different, and any content they're known for:
- Jordan Crawford / Blueprint GTM (blueprintgtm.com)
- Nick Zeckets / Smoke Signals (smokesignals.ai)
- Willy Hernandez / The GTM Factory (thegtmfactory.com)
- Jacob Dietle / Taste Systems (taste.systems)
- Mike Fishbein / Atherial AI (atherial.ai)
- Eric Nowoslawski / Growth Engine X (growthenginex.com)
- Sagar Tiwari / Blue Modern Advisory (bluemodern.com)"

2. "What is Garrett Wolfe's AOB (getaob.com)? What do they offer, how do they position, and what's their pricing model?"

3. "Who are the most prominent fractional GTM engineers on LinkedIn and Twitter right now? What are they posting about and how are they generating clients?"
```

**For each person, capture:**
- Their headline / one-liner positioning
- Services offered (retainer vs project vs hourly)
- Pricing if visible
- Key differentiator (what they claim makes them different)
- Content strategy (what they post about, where)
- Weakness / gap in their offering

### Part B: Clay Agencies (The Bigger Players)

## Module 2: Buyer Intelligence (15 min)

**What you're trying to learn:** How do founders and GTM leaders describe the problem you solve? What words do they use? What have they tried that didn't work?

### Perplexity Queries

```
1. "What do Series A and B startup founders say about their biggest GTM challenges? What specific pain points come up repeatedly on LinkedIn, Reddit, and in podcasts?"

2. "When B2B startups look for help with outbound sales infrastructure, what do they search for? What terms and phrases do they use — 'outbound agency,' 'Clay consultant,' 'fractional RevOps,' something else?"

3. "What are the most common complaints about hiring fractional GTM help or Clay agencies? What goes wrong — overpromising, generic playbooks, no results, too expensive?"

4. "What does the buying process look like when a startup decides to hire a fractional GTM engineer vs building in-house vs using an agency? What triggers the decision?"
```

```
1. "How are B2B startups using Clay for outbound sales in 2025-2026? What are the most common workflows and highest-value use cases?"

2. "What is GTM engineering as a discipline? How has it evolved with AI tools like Clay, Claude Code, and automation platforms? What skills define a top GTM engineer?"

3. "Where do companies get stuck with Clay? What are the most common failure modes — bad data, wrong enrichment strategy, poor prompt engineering, no integration with CRM?"
```

### Save output as: `research/03-clay-ai-landscape.md`

### What to capture:
- Most common Clay use cases
- Where companies get stuck (the gap between buying Clay and getting pipeline)
- How the AI/prompt engineering layer creates a moat
- What separates a good Clay implementation from a bad one

---

## Module 4: Lead Magnet Research (10 min)

**What you're trying to learn:** What lead magnets work in this space, and should the GTM Scorecard be yours or should you build something different?

### Perplexity Queries

```
1. "What lead magnets are GTM consultants, RevOps agencies, and Clay agencies using to generate leads? Audit tools, ROI calculators, templates, assessments, free strategy sessions, teardowns? What's working and what's overdone?"

2. "What are the highest-converting lead magnet formats for B2B consulting services? Interactive tools vs PDFs vs free audits vs webinars?"

3. "What examples exist of GTM or sales consultants using a free assessment or scorecard as their lead generation tool? How do they structure it?"
```

### Save output as: `research/04-lead-magnet-research.md`

- Ideas for lead magnets that would be unique given your skills
- Comparison criteria: Scorecard vs whatever else emerges

---

## Module 5: Positioning White Space (10 min)

**Don't run new Perplexity queries for this.** Instead, have Claude synthesize.

Open `01-competitive-landscape.md`, `02-buyer-intelligence.md`, and `03-clay-ai-landscape.md` and ask:

```
"Based on this competitive research and buyer intelligence, identify:

1. OVERUSED ANGLES: What positioning is everyone using? (e.g., 'we build your outbound engine,' 'AI-powered lead gen,' 'more pipeline less BDRs')

2. UNDERSERVED GAPS: What do buyers want that nobody is clearly offering?

3. MY UNIQUE ANGLE: Given my background — 9 months as a GTME at Clay Labs building enrichment pipelines and signal-based workflows for enterprise clients (LeanTaaS, Gleamer, Moorepay), plus 2.6 years at Rutter doing SDR/AE work, plus deep Clay, Salesforce, HubSpot, and prompt engineering skills — where do I have a positioning advantage that these competitors don't?

4. TOP 3 POSITIONING OPTIONS: Ranked by differentiation strength. For each, give me: the one-liner, who it appeals to, and why it's different from what's out there."
```

## Module 6: Content & Channel Recon (10 min)

**What you're trying to learn:** Where should you show up and what content works?

### Perplexity Queries

```
1. "What content formats work best for GTM consultants and fractional RevOps people to generate inbound leads? LinkedIn posts, Twitter threads, newsletters, YouTube, community posts?"

2. "What are the most active communities for GTM engineers and RevOps professionals? Slack groups, Discord, Reddit, etc. Where do buyers hang out?"

3. "What GTM engineering or Clay-related content has gotten high engagement recently? What topics and formats resonate?"
```

### Save output as: `research/06-content-channels.md`

### What to capture:
- Which channels have the highest ROI at your stage (pre-audience)
- What content generates DMs/replies vs just likes
- Communities worth posting in (Claude Slack, Clay community, etc.)
- Content ideas that map to your "show the build" strength

---

## Final Step: Synthesis

After all 6 modules, run this:

```
"Read all research files in /research/. Then give me:

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: What does this market look like in 3-5 sentences?

2. MY POSITIONING: Based on my background (Clay Labs GTME, enrichment pipelines, signal-based workflows, AI qualification systems, Claude Code skills) and the competitive gaps identified, what's the single strongest positioning angle?

3. MY OFFER: What should the packaged offer look like? Scope, deliverables, timeline, price range. Give me 2-3 tiers.

4. MY LEAD MAGNET: Compare the GTM Scorecard I already built against whatever other lead magnet ideas emerged from the research. Recommend the best option and explain why.

5. MY LANDING PAGE HEADLINE: Give me 5 options for the hero headline.

6. COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE: What can I say that Jordan Crawford, Nick Zeckets, ColdIQ, and The Kiln can't?

7. NEXT STEPS: What should I build first — landing page, case study, lead magnet refinement, or content?"
```

## What Comes Next (Steps 2-7 from James's Playbook)

Once research is done:

- **Step 2: Positioning** — Pick your angle from the synthesis. Lock it in.
- **Step 3: Landing Page** — Build it in Cursor. Single page, clear offer, one CTA.
- **Step 4: Lead Magnet** — Either refine the Scorecard or build whatever won from the research. Integrate into landing page.
- **Step 5: Email Sequence** — Nurture for people who engage with the lead magnet.
- **Step 6: Traffic** — Community posts (Claude Slack, Clay community, LinkedIn, X). Show-the-build content. DM Scorecard/lead magnet results to prospects.
- **Step 7: Deploy** — Ship the page, start posting, generate conversations.

---

## Reminders

- Don't skip to the landing page without doing this research. That's where generic output comes from.
- Total time: ~60-75 minutes. You'll come out with positioning, an offer structure, lead magnet decision, and headline options.
- Save everything. The research files feed into every downstream step.
- You already know a lot of these competitors personally. Let the research confirm or challenge your assumptions — don't just validate what you already think.
