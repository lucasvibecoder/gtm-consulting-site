# Module 6: Content & Channel Recon

**Date:** February 2026
**Goal:** Identify where to show up and what content formats work best for generating inbound leads as a fractional GTM engineer / Clay consultant.

---

## 1. PLATFORM HIERARCHY — Where Inbound Revenue Actually Originates

### LinkedIn: The Primary Channel (Highest ROI)

**Why LinkedIn dominates:**
- Organic LinkedIn content generates 2-6% engagement rates vs 0.4-0.6% for sponsored posts
- Posts optimized for psychological engagement generate 2-5x higher comment rates
- The professional context means GTM leaders are actively evaluating solutions during working hours
- One case study: Founder's LinkedIn presence generated $2M in pipeline, $1.2M in closed deals — no paid advertising

**What works on LinkedIn:**
- Framework posts that teach methodology (pain-based segmentation, permissionless value propositions)
- Technical breakdowns showing step-by-step workflows
- Before-and-after case studies with specific metrics
- Question-based posts that spark substantive professional debate (not yes/no engagement-bait)
- Behind-the-scenes posts showing real systems, challenges, and failures

**LinkedIn algorithm changes (2026):**
- Shifted from vanity metrics (likes) to "Depth Score" — measures how long users engage with content
- Comment depth matters more than comment count — substantive discussions get broader distribution
- Posts that reward sustained attention outperform quick-engagement posts
- Friday underperforms by ~20% — timing matters less than content quality

**For Lucas specifically:**
- Your "show the build" strength maps perfectly to LinkedIn's algorithm preference for technical depth
- Framework posts about Clay-to-pipeline systems will naturally accrue high Depth Scores
- Case studies from your Clay Labs work (LeanTaaS, Gleamer, Moorepay) are perfect LinkedIn content

---

### Twitter/X: Secondary Channel (Community & Relationship Building)

**Why Twitter/X is secondary:**
- Less direct lead generation than LinkedIn
- Functions as a community platform for real-time engagement
- Builds credibility through participation in trending conversations
- Generates referrals and partnerships more than direct client inquiries

**What works on Twitter/X:**
- Real-time commentary on industry developments
- Provocative, contrarian takes (more than LinkedIn tolerates)
- Quick tactical insights and rapid feedback on methodologies
- Threads that teach frameworks in digestible format

**For Lucas specifically:**
- Use Twitter to test ideas and get rapid feedback
- Share quick wins and tactical Clay tips
- Engage with the GTM engineering community in real-time
- Build relationships that lead to referrals

---

### YouTube: Emerging Opportunity (Underutilized)

**Why YouTube matters:**
- B2B buyers increasingly seek depth on YouTube
- Algorithm prioritizes watch time and return viewership (vs LinkedIn's engagement focus)
- Educational content continues generating views months/years after publication
- Demonstrates communication clarity — essential for advisory engagements

**What works on YouTube:**
- Short breakdowns of GTM concepts (5-10 minutes)
- Tactical walk-throughs of campaign execution
- "Office hours" style content reviewing real client examples
- Educational content about methodologies (teach what you do with clients)

**For Lucas specifically:**
- Record yourself building Clay workflows — screen recordings with voiceover
- Walk through signal-to-play architecture systems you built at Clay Labs
- Show prompt engineering in action — before/after examples
- Case study deep-dives: "How I turned Clay into pipeline for [client]"

**Best practices:**
- Consistency: 3-4 posts per month
- Value-add storytelling through real-world case studies
- Educational content addressing specific industry challenges

---

### Email Newsletters: Owned Audience Infrastructure

**Why newsletters work:**
- Build owned audience independent of platform algorithms
- Progressive curriculum approach (teach methodology over time)
- Low-cost way to maintain thought leadership
- Captures email addresses of engaged readers

**What works:**
- Free foundational content that builds trust
- Advanced implementation guides for paid subscribers
- Proprietary frameworks unavailable elsewhere
- Extensions of your intellectual journey, not promotional vehicles

**Examples:**
- Jordan Crawford's Cannonball GTM Substack — teaches FIND methodology progressively
- Free content builds trust → paid tier segments for deeper engagement

**For Lucas specifically:**
- Newsletter teaching your Clay-to-pipeline methodology
- Share frameworks you use with clients (signal architecture, prompt engineering)
- Progressive teaching: start with basics, advance to sophisticated systems
- Use as lead magnet delivery mechanism

---

## 2. CONTENT FORMATS THAT GENERATE ACTUAL CONVERSATIONS

### The Framework: What Actually Converts vs Vanity Metrics

**Metrics that matter:**
- Direct messages and inquiries received
- Calendar bookings initiated
- Email subscribers who request conversations
- Referrals generated from existing followers
- Quality of conversations in comments (not just "great content" but implementation questions)

**Metrics that don't matter:**
- Follower count (smaller, highly engaged audience > large, superficial audience)
- Like counts (8-12% engagement with 2,000 ideal clients > 1-2% with 50,000 mixed audience)
- Generic praise comments

**The "List is the Message" principle:**
- Reaching the right 1,000 people with relevant message > reaching 100,000 with generic advice
- Quality and relevance > raw reach

---

### High-Performing Content Formats

#### 1. Viral Lead Magnet Posts with Structured Delivery Systems

**Structure:**
- Asset description (framework, checklist, template)
- Why this asset took significant work (50+ hours mentioned explicitly)
- Mechanism for delivery (transparent about constraints)
- Metrics from the campaign

**Why it works:**
- Describing work invested justifies value
- Transparency about delivery signals respect for platform policies
- Sharing metrics proves the asset actually drove results

**Example:** Maja Voje's 5-step viral post framework
- 100,000+ impressions, 1,000+ followers in 24 hours
- Honest about constraints: "I'm limited to 150 messages/day"
- Shared effort: "$1,000 opportunity cost, 30+ hours of work"
- Result: "5-12x returns based on campaigns"

**For Lucas:**
- Offer free Clay workflow templates or signal architecture frameworks
- Be transparent about delivery mechanism
- Share metrics from your own implementations

---

#### 2. Before-and-After Frameworks with Specific Numbers

**Structure:**
- Clear "before" state with specific metrics
- Clear "after" state with specific metrics
- Mechanism that drove change
- Avoid inflated causation claims

**Why it works:**
- Quantifies the gap between pre- and post-implementation
- Makes abstract improvements tangible
- Honest assessment builds credibility

**Examples:**
- "ServiceBell booked 30 meetings with 1 hour of work after implementing Clay workflows"
- "Reduced manual research time by 95% while achieving higher engagement rates"
- "Automated manual tasks consuming 40 hours weekly per rep"

**For Lucas:**
- Case studies from Clay Labs work: "How I built enrichment pipelines that increased match rates from 40% to 85%"
- Show specific workflows you built for enterprise clients
- Quantify time saved, pipeline generated, or efficiency gains

---

#### 3. Technical Breakdowns of Specific Workflows

**Structure:**
- Problem statement
- System architecture diagram or workflow visualization
- Step-by-step breakdown of each stage
- Example output
- Metrics or results

**Why it works:**
- Makes abstract strategies concrete and replicable
- Demonstrates technical depth
- Provides immediate value (readers can implement)
- High Depth Score (LinkedIn algorithm rewards sustained attention)

**Examples:**
- Swan's AI agent stack breakdown — what each agent does, tools used, how outputs feed next agent
- GTMfund's distribution systems — how one startup became active in 700-person Facebook groups
- Multi-stage automated workflows with waterfall enrichment logic

**For Lucas:**
- Perfect format for your "show the build" strength
- Walk through signal-to-play systems you built at Clay Labs
- Show prompt engineering architecture (multi-prompt qualification systems)
- Break down enrichment pipelines step-by-step

---

#### 4. Question-Based and Poll Posts (Substantive, Not Engagement-Bait)

**What works:**
- Questions that spark genuine professional debate
- Paired with data to make questions substantive
- "Are you using signal-based selling or volume-based outreach?"
- "What's the most underrated GTM metric?"
- "Should GTM teams consolidate around fewer tools or maintain flexibility?"

**What doesn't work:**
- Yes/no questions with obvious answers
- Generic engagement-bait
- Questions without data foundation

**Why it works:**
- LinkedIn algorithm rewards substantive discussion
- Generates comment volume that reflects actual engagement
- Positions you as someone who thinks deeply about GTM challenges

---

#### 5. Behind-the-Scenes and Process-Transparency Posts

**Structure:**
- Reveal actual systems, challenges, and failures
- Show iteration process (failed → refined → succeeded)
- Acknowledge friction and complexity

**Why it works:**
- Audiences value honesty about implementation difficulty
- Trust narratives that acknowledge friction more than effortless results
- Positions you as someone who solves problems through iteration

**Examples:**
- "I built this automation, then discovered it was creating problems, then refined it again"
- "Failed messaging in cold email campaigns, then showing what eventually worked"
- "30-60 minutes per post, guiding AI section by section rather than one-shot generation"

**For Lucas:**
- Share challenges you faced building systems at Clay Labs
- Show how you iterated on signal detection logic
- Be honest about prompt engineering failures and what you learned

---

### Content Topics That Drive High Engagement

#### Signal-Based Selling and Buyer Intent Frameworks
- **Why it works:** Addresses universal frustration with volume-based outreach
- **Format:** Show specific signals detected + exact message sent + outcome
- **Example:** "Champion job change + Series B funding + G2 research → personalized email + LinkedIn ads → meeting booked"

#### Data Enrichment and Waterfall Approaches
- **Why it works:** Dirty data directly kills pipeline — practitioners face this daily
- **Format:** Before/after match rates (40% → 85%), specific enrichment logic
- **Example:** "Cut prospecting data budget by 65% while building better lead lists"

#### Agentic AI and AI Workflows for GTM
- **Why it works:** Addresses scaling without proportional headcount increases
- **Format:** Specific, bounded applications (not "AI will change everything")
- **Example:** "AI system extracts themes from call transcripts → LinkedIn post ideas"

#### Outbound Infrastructure and Sales Sequences
- **Why it works:** Challenges conventional wisdom with data
- **Format:** Multi-channel orchestration results (15-25% response rates vs 3-5% single-channel)
- **Example:** "Coordinated email + LinkedIn + phone → specific timing details"

#### Prompt Engineering and Sales Messaging
- **Why it works:** Most teams waste 30-50% of AI investment on poor prompting
- **Format:** Copy-paste prompts that actually work, common mistakes to avoid
- **Example:** "Goal → Context → Persona → Format" prompt structure with examples
