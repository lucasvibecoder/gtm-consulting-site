- **Prompt Engineering:** Advanced. Built multi-prompt qualification systems, AI-powered research agents, buyer intelligence extraction
- **Salesforce & HubSpot:** Deep CRM knowledge from years of daily use
- **AI Tools:** Claude Code, Cursor, automation platforms
- **Data Enrichment:** Waterfall strategies, provider selection, data quality management
- **Signal-Based GTM:** Job postings, technographic signals, funding events, intent data → automated plays

## What I'm Building Right Now

## What I'm Great At
- Building systems from scratch (blank canvas → working automation)
- Deep research and strategic analysis
- Clay workflow architecture
- Prompt engineering and AI-powered qualification
- Connecting data sources into actionable intelligence
- Understanding buyer psychology from years of SDR/AE work
- Creative problem-solving and pattern recognition

## What Drains Me
- High-volume meetings and context switching
- Traditional sales activities (pipeline management, forecast calls)
- Repetitive execution without building
- Being in a pure closer/AE role

## Working Style
- Night owl who thrives on uninterrupted deep work
- Builder, not a closer — prefers creating systems over running sales processes
- Achieves flow state through clear tasks + deep curiosity + AI iteration
- Can get stuck in analysis paralysis and perfectionism
- Prefers positive framing (believes in law of attraction)

## What Makes Me Different From Other GTM Consultants
- **Actually worked at Clay Labs** — not just a Clay user, but someone who built systems for Clay's own enterprise clients
- **Technical + strategic hybrid** — can think about ICP and positioning AND build the Clay tables and prompts to execute
- **Prompt engineering depth** — most Clay consultants drag and drop; I build multi-step AI qualification systems
- **Signal-based GTM expertise** — built real signal → play systems, not just talked about them
- **Buyer psychology from sales experience** — 4+ years of SDR/AE work means I understand what actually converts, not just what looks good in a workflow
- **AI-native builder** — using Claude Code, Cursor, and AI tools to build things most consultants can't
