## What Thresh Is

Signal-based outbound intelligence. We find public data that proves a company's prospects have a problem right now, build the list, write the messages, and hand over the deliverable. The client sends it through whatever channel fits their buyer — email, phone, LinkedIn, direct mail.

**What Thresh is not:** A Clay agency. An SDR service. A CRM consultancy. An email infrastructure provider. We deliver intelligence and messages. The client owns execution.

## The Offer

**Day 1 (free sample):** 10 prospects experiencing a specific public trigger, enriched with decision-maker contacts, each with a 3-4 sentence insight-based message. Delivered as a CSV. No charge.

**Paid engagement:** $3,000-5,000/month. 100 new prospects per month, one signal, one vertical. Messages written. Contacts enriched. CSV delivered. Signal refined monthly based on what converts.

**Upsell path (Month 4+):** Add signals, add verticals, add call transcript analysis (trade Gong access for sharper messaging). Retainer grows with scope.

## ICP Definition

### Firmographics

| Attribute | Criteria |
|-----------|----------|
| Company stage | Seed to Series B ($1M-$25M ARR) |
| Team size | 10-200 employees |
| Sales motion | Founder-led or small sales team (1-5 reps) |
| Category | Vertical SaaS, B2B services, or industrial technology |
| Buyer's industry | Must sell into regulated, licensed, or inspected industries where federal/state/local public data tracks their buyers' problems. Examples but not limited to: construction, fleet management, energy, commercial real estate, data centers, automotive, local services, fintech, healthcare facilities, manufacturing |
| Geography | US-based (federal databases are US-centric for now) |
| GTM maturity | Has a product, has some customers, doing outbound but results are mediocre. Not pre-product. Not enterprise with a 20-person sales org. |

### Qualifying Signals (how we know they're ready to buy)

| Signal | Why it matters |
|--------|---------------|
| Recently hired first SDR or AE | They're investing in outbound but don't have sophisticated targeting yet |
| Active Clay account | They've bought the tool but likely struggling to get value from it |
| Founder posting about outbound challenges on LinkedIn | Self-identified pain |
| Raised seed/Series A in last 12 months | Have budget, have growth pressure, likely founder-led sales |
| Selling into a compliance-heavy vertical | Their buyers have public data we can exploit |
| Currently using ZoomInfo/Apollo + generic sequences | Doing outbound the old way — high volume, low signal |

### The Information Asymmetry Test

Before taking any engagement, answer one question: **Does public data exist about their prospects' problems that their prospects don't know is being tracked?**

- If yes → green light. The signal creates genuine information asymmetry.
- If no → walk away. Without asymmetry, the messages are just better-written cold emails, not intelligence.

Examples that pass:
- Fleet carriers don't know their FMCSA driver OOS rate is visible and comparable
- Building owners don't know their ENERGY STAR score and LL97 penalty exposure are calculable from public data
- Data center operators don't know their cooling specs are publishable alongside GPU roadmaps
- Construction companies don't know their OSHA investigation history is cross-referenceable with their permit filings
- Auto dealerships don't know their warranty complaint patterns and FTC enforcement exposure are trackable from public filings
- Fintech companies don't know their prospects' state money transmitter license status and FinCEN registration gaps are public record

Examples that fail:
- SaaS companies selling to other SaaS companies — buyers are data-literate, no asymmetry
- Consumer brands selling DTC — no meaningful public compliance data on individual consumers
- Recruiting firms selling to tech companies — hiring data is already commoditized via LinkedIn

## Buyer Personas

### Persona 1: The Vertical SaaS Founder

**Title:** CEO / Co-Founder
**Company:** Seed to Series A vertical SaaS
**Team:** 5-30 people, likely no dedicated sales team yet
**Day-to-day:** Product, fundraising, and doing founder-led sales between everything else
**Quota pressure:** Needs to show pipeline and early revenue to raise next round

**Pain points (in their words):**
- "I know our ICP but I don't have time to build lists and personalize every email"
- "We bought Clay but I burned $500 in credits and still don't have a working workflow"
- "Our outbound sounds generic — we get 1-2% reply rates and most replies are 'not interested'"
- "I know there's public data about our buyers' problems but I don't know where to find it or how to use it"
- "I can't afford a $15K/month agency and I don't want to hire an SDR yet"

**What they actually need:** Someone to hand them a list of 100 companies experiencing the exact problem their product solves, with the evidence attached and the messages written. They send it. It books meetings.

**Trigger to buy:** They've tried generic outbound for 2-3 months and it's not working. They're about to either hire an SDR ($60K+ fully loaded) or pay an agency ($5-15K/month). The free 10-prospect sample lands at this exact moment and shows them a different way.

**Channel:** Email works if they're technical founders who live in their inbox. LinkedIn DM for founders active on the platform. Warm intro through Clay community, Primary Ventures network, or mutual connections is strongest.

### Persona 2: The Growth Lead at Mid-Market B2B

**Title:** Head of Growth / VP Sales / Revenue Operations
**Company:** Series A-B, $5-25M ARR
**Team:** 3-10 person sales team, possibly 1-2 SDRs already
**Day-to-day:** Pipeline targets, campaign management, reporting to CEO/CRO

**Pain points (in their words):**
- "Our SDRs are sending 200 emails a day and booking maybe 3 meetings a week"
- "We use the same intent data as every other company in our space — job postings, funding announcements, website visits. Nothing differentiates our outreach."
- "I need something that makes our outbound stand out because every inbox is flooded with AI-personalized garbage"
- "My CEO keeps asking why our reply rates are dropping and I don't have a good answer"

**What they actually need:** A signal source their competitors aren't using. Not more volume, not better copy — intelligence their reps can use that no competitor is sending. Thresh arms the existing team with data advantages, not replacement workflows.

**Trigger to buy:** Reply rates have dropped below 1%. CEO is questioning outbound spend. They've already tried switching email copy, subject lines, and sequencing cadences. The problem isn't the words — it's the targeting.

**Channel:** Email works. These buyers live in their inbox. LinkedIn content showing real examples (anonymized) gets their attention because they're actively looking for new approaches.

## Disqualifications

### Hard Disqualifications (immediate no)

| Signal | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Horizontal SaaS selling to tech buyers | No information asymmetry. Buyers are data-literate. Public compliance data doesn't exist for their market. |
| No public data about their buyers' problems | If the Information Asymmetry Test fails, the deliverable is just better-written cold email, not intelligence. Walk away. |
| "Experimental AI budget" | Client wants to "try AI outbound" without a clear ICP or sales motion. These engagements die after month 1. Revenue is not worth the time. |
| Pre-product / pre-revenue | They don't have something to sell yet. The signal-based list is useless without a product behind it. |
| Needs CRM management, inbox setup, SDR management, or sending infrastructure | That's not what Thresh does. Refer them to a Clay agency or ops consultant. |
| Burned sending domains / terrible deliverability and unwilling to fix it | If their emails go to spam, they'll blame the data. Qualifying question before engagement: "What's your current open rate and how many domains are you sending from?" If the answer is bad and they won't fix it, walk. |

### Soft Disqualifications (proceed with caution)

| Signal | Why | Mitigation |
|--------|-----|------------|
| Very small TAM (< 500 total companies in their market) | Signal-based approach may exhaust the market in 2-3 months. Short engagement lifespan. | Price as a one-time project, not a retainer. Or expand to adjacent verticals. |
| Blue collar buyers who don't check email | The messages are strong but the channel may not work for cold email specifically. | Frame deliverable as "messages" not "emails." Output works for call scripts, LinkedIn outreach, or direct mail. Discuss channel fit in the qualifying call. |
| Client wants guaranteed meeting counts | Thresh delivers intelligence and messages, not booked meetings. Too many variables between the list and the meeting (their rep quality, their sending infra, their follow-up speed). | Set expectations upfront: "I control the quality of the data and the messages. You control the execution. If the data is right and the messages are sharp, meetings follow — but I don't guarantee a number." |
| Large enterprise (500+ employees, complex procurement) | Long sales cycles, procurement review, legal review on data sourcing. Not worth it at $3-5K/month price point. | Only engage if there's a champion who can buy on a credit card or through a small consulting PO. Otherwise, pass until Thresh has case studies and higher pricing. |

### The 5-Minute Qualifying Checklist

Before any engagement, answer these five questions:

1. **Does public data exist about their buyers' problems?** (If no → hard stop)
2. **Do their buyers not already know this data is public?** (If buyers already track it → no asymmetry → hard stop)
3. **Is their sending infrastructure healthy?** (If burned domains and won't fix → hard stop)
4. **Do they have a sales motion that can act on the list?** (If no one is sending emails or making calls → too early)
5. **Can they pay $3-5K/month after the free sample?** (If the budget isn't there → friendly no, revisit later)

If all five are yes, take the engagement. If any are no, either fix the blocker first or walk.
